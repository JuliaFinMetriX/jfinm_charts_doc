# Description

This repository contains examples for chart functions of the
`JFinM_Charts` Julia package. As I am usually not allowed to
distribute the data I use, even though it is freely available on the
internet, I will artificially distort the data by adding random noise.
If you want to get the original data, simply follow the data creation
script and omit the randomization part.

Data will generally reside in directory `data`, so that any file can
be reused for multiple charts. All script files that were used to come
up with the data can be found in directory `dataCreation`. In case
that randomization functions are required multiple times, they are
stored in directory `src`.
